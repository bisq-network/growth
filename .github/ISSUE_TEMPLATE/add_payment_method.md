Payment methods are evaluated very carefully before being added to Bisq. Poorly integrating a payment method, or integrating a payment method that's not a good fit for Bisq's trading protocol, can be costly mistakes for Bisq's users and dispute resolution mechanisms.

As a result, we request that you add responses to the following questions so that we can better consider your suggestion.

Please answer to the best of your ability. The more thorough you can be, the more you'll help us out, and the quicker your suggestion can be evaluated and implemented.
